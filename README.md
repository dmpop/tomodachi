# Tomodachi

Tomodachi is a hardware add-on that extends functionality of a Raspberry Pi-compatible single-board computer. The board features an 128x64 LCD screen, two LEDs, and two push buttons. Thanks to its simplicity and versatility, the board can be put to a wide variety of practical and creative uses.

Tomodachi was originally designed as a companion to [Little Backup Box](https://github.com/dmpop/little-backup-box). However, the accompanying shell scripts transform the Raspberry Pi into a self-contained appliance that can run custom commands via a programmable button-driven on-screen menu.
