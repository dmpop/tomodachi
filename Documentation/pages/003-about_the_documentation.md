# About this documentation

This documentation provides instructions on how to build a Tomodachi board as well as install and configure the required software. The documentation also describes several Tomodoachi-based projects.

# Prerequisites

You need a Raspberry Pi Model 3 or 4 and a bootable microSD card with the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite. Besides basic soldering skills, building your own Tomodachi device requires basic Linux knowledge:

- Establishing an SSH connection
- Editing files
- Running shell scripts and executing basic commands from the command line
- Understanding how Linux handles external devices

It also helps to be familiar with Raspberry Pi and single-board computers in general.
